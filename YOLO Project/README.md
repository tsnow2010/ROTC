# Military Vehicle Recognition Project (with 12 Classes of Vehicles)

### Purpose: To use Ultralytics YOLOv11 to test the viablility of using computer vision to recognize over 10 classes of military vehicles.  The project will answer whether accuracy will improve with greater classes and whether computer vision will be able to recognize key features distinguishing military vehicles with different purposes.

### Method: 
#### Project utilizes Ultralytics YOLO v11 for its computer vision modeling capabilities.

#### Classification:
#### I attempt to identify military vehicles into (12) different classes:
> - Tank: TNK
> - Armored Personnel Carrier: APC
> - Intercontinental Ballistic Missile: ICBM
> - Infantry Mobility Vehicle: IMV
> - Self-Propelled Howitzer: SPH
> - Multiple Rocket Launcher System: MRLS
> - Short Range Ballistic Missile: SRBM
> - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Carrier: UAVC
> - Surface-to-Air Missile: SAM
> - Infantry Fighting Vehicle: IFV
> - Cargo Truck: CT
> - Scout Car: SC
